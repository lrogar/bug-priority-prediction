# CSCI6100G Advanced Topics in Software Design

## Details

**Description**:

Implementing or solving a problem utilizing a learning algorithm:

- Present a solution from a new problem.
- Present a solution from an already existing paper (e.g. same data, different algorithm).

**Proposal**:

- *Presentation*: Due November 9th, 2017
- *Report*: TBA

### Data Set

A Dataset of High Impact Bugs: Manually-Classified Issue Reports

- *Paper*: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.uproxy.library.dc-uoit.ca/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180132

- *Dataset*: http://oss.sys.wakayama-u.ac.jp/?p=1009

#### Proposal Feedback

Include other work to predict bug priority using this same dataset, then compare with our approach.

- Look up what research cites the MSR 2015 paper & look up papers on predicting defect priority with deep learning/ML.

To take into account: Different projects with different predominant bug priority types may be a pitfall.
